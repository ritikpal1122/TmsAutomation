**TestMu AI Tunnel** is a secure and encrypted tunneling feature that allows devs and QAs to test their locally hosted web applications or websites on the cloud-based real machines. It establishes a secure connection between the user's local machine and the real machine in the cloud. There are multiple connectivity options like **TCP with TLS 1.2 over port 443** , **Websocket (port 443)** ,. Tunnel Binary performs network scanning and selects the best mode if not explicitly specified.

> All Tunnel credentials (access keys, API tokens, etc.) are private and confidential. A system compromise may result in their unauthorized disclosure; therefore, you must secure the machine running the TestMu AI tunnel. Do not share or expose credentials in public code, repositories, or environments. In the event of a compromise, you are solely responsible for immediately revoking and regenerating the credentials. TestMu AI assumes no liability for any losses arising from failure to comply.

## Why to Use TestMu AI Tunnel?[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages#why-to-use--tunnel "Direct link to why-to-use--tunnel")

TestMu AI Tunnel offers numerous benefits for web developers, testers, and QA professionals. These include secure and encrypted connection, cross-browser compatibility testing, localhost testing, etc.

  * **Secured and Encrypted :** It provides a secure and encrypted connection between your local machine and the virtual machines in the cloud, thereby ensuring the privacy of your test data and online communications.
  * **Cost Effective :** With TestMu AI Tunnel, you can test your web applications or websites, local folder, and files across a wide range of browsers and operating systems without setting up complex and expensive local testing environments.
  * **Test on Real Environment :** It lets you test your locally hosted web applications or websites on cloud-based real OS machines. You can even run accessibility tests on desktop browsers while testing locally hosted web applications and pages.

> Please note that the TestMu AI tunnel client does not include any AI or ML capabilities, and none of the data it proxies is used for AI or ML training.
