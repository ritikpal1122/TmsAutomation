When testing private or restricted environments on TestMu AI, your team may need to configure network access controls. Depending on how your applications are hosted and secured, TestMu AI supports multiple approaches **Inbound Whitelisting, Dedicated Proxy, Outbound Whitelisting, STUN/TURN Whitelisting, and Tunnel configurations (including Site-to-Site tunnels)**.

> These are Inbound and Outbound with respect to user's network.

This guide helps you decide which option to use for your infrastructure setup.

## 1\. When Inbound Whitelisting Has to Be Done (Shared IP)[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#1-when-inbound-whitelisting-has-to-be-done-shared-ip "Direct link to 1. When Inbound Whitelisting Has to Be Done \(Shared IP\)")

Inbound IP whitelisting allows TestMu AI cloud browsers and devices to directly access your IP-restricted web applications without using a tunnel.

#### When to Use[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")

  * Your resources (e.g., staging sites, dashboards, APIs) are publicly accessible on the internet, but locked down to requests from trusted IPs.
  * Your firewall or access control list (ACL) supports adding static IPs.
  * You want to avoid maintaining tunnels for each test run.

#### Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#example "Direct link to Example")

  * A staging environment at staging.company.com is accessible only from a set of static IPs.
  * By whitelisting TestMu AIâs shared public IPs, your QA team can test directly on the cloud grid.

> Refer to [TestMu AI Public IP](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/testmu-public-ip/) for list for the IP addresses.

## 2\. When Dedicated Proxy Whitelisting Has to Be Done[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#2-when-dedicated-proxy-whitelisting-has-to-be-done "Direct link to 2. When Dedicated Proxy Whitelisting Has to Be Done")

Dedicated Proxy Whitelisting provides an extra layer of security by assigning a unique static IP exclusively for your organization.

#### When to Use[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#when-to-use-1 "Direct link to When to Use")

  * You want isolation from other TestMu AI customers (no shared IPs).
  * Your compliance or security policies mandate that only your companyâs traffic be routed through a controlled IP.
  * You want easier log tracking, auditing, or firewall rules with a single source IP.

#### Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#example-1 "Direct link to Example")

  * A banking app testing environment requires that only a customer-specific IP be allowed, not shared infrastructure IPs.
  * You request a dedicated proxy IP from TestMu AI and whitelist only that.

## 3\. When Outbound Whitelisting Is Required[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#3-when-outbound-whitelisting-is-required "Direct link to 3. When Outbound Whitelisting Is Required")

Outbound whitelisting applies when your corporate network restricts users from accessing external domains.

#### When to Use[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#when-to-use-2 "Direct link to When to Use")

  * Your testers cannot reach lambdatest.com or related subdomains because of firewall/proxy rules.
  * You need to ensure your employeesâ browsers and TestMu AI integrations can connect to the platform.

#### What to Whitelist[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#what-to-whitelist "Direct link to What to Whitelist")

  * `*.lambdatest.com` (all subdomains)
  * Standard ports `80` and `443`

#### Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#example-2 "Direct link to Example")

A QA engineer inside a corporate VPN is unable to resolve `hub.lambdatest.com`. Once `*.lambdatest.com` is whitelisted, they can execute tests without connection issues.

## 4\. When STUN/TURN Server Whitelisting Is Required[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#4-when-stunturn-server-whitelisting-is-required "Direct link to 4. When STUN/TURN Server Whitelisting Is Required")

For real-time testing sessions (browser, VM, or real device), TestMu AI uses the WebRTC protocol to stream video. This requires access to STUN/TURN servers.

#### When to Use[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#when-to-use-3 "Direct link to When to Use")

  * You notice slowness in live sessions.
  * VM/real device sessions are not launching.
  * The video stream falls back to Guacamole (slower protocol) instead of WebRTC.

#### What to Whitelist[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#what-to-whitelist-1 "Direct link to What to Whitelist")

Allow TLS traffic on ports 80 and 443 for the following servers:
    
    
    stun-us-1.lambdatest.com    
    stun-us-2.lambdatest.com    
    stun-eu-1.lambdatest.com    
    stun-eu-2.lambdatest.com    
    stun-as-1.lambdatest.com    
    stun-ap-2.lambdatest.com    
    

#### Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#example-3 "Direct link to Example")

If a tester in Europe is experiencing lag in live testing sessions, whitelisting `stun-eu-1.lambdatest.com` and `stun-eu-2.lambdatest.com` resolves it.

## 5\. When Whitelisting Will Not Help (Tunnel Required)[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#5-when-whitelisting-will-not-help-tunnel-required "Direct link to 5. When Whitelisting Will Not Help \(Tunnel Required\)")

Whitelisting only works if your application is publicly discoverable on the internet (with IP restrictions). If your resources are inside a private network, on localhost, or on a non-routable subnet, whitelisting will not work.

#### Use TestMu AI Tunnel Instead[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#use--tunnel-instead "Direct link to use--tunnel-instead")

The Tunnel binary (or Underpass app) creates a secure outbound connection from your machine/network to TestMu AI, enabling the cloud to access:

  * Localhost apps (<http://localhost:3000>)
  * Internal apps behind VPN or private subnets (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x)
  * Apps accessible only within your corporate LAN

#### Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#example-4 "Direct link to Example")

  * A developer wants to test a React app running on `http://localhost:3000`. Whitelisting wonât work because itâs not internet-exposed.
  * Solution: Start a TestMu AI Tunnel session and run tests.

## 6\. When Site-to-Site (S2S) Tunnel Should Be Used[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#6-when-site-to-site-s2s-tunnel-should-be-used "Direct link to 6. When Site-to-Site \(S2S\) Tunnel Should Be Used")

For enterprise-grade setups, a Site-to-Site (S2S) tunnel provides a persistent, secure connection between your corporate network and TestMu AI.

#### When to Use[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#when-to-use-4 "Direct link to When to Use")

  * You want to avoid starting a tunnel for each session.
  * Your entire QA team needs always-on secure connectivity.
  * You have strict compliance requirements (no public exposure, no shared infrastructure).
  * Youâre testing large-scale or highly regulated environments (finance, healthcare, government).

#### Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/network-whitelisting-and-tunnel-guide#example-5 "Direct link to Example")

A bank sets up a permanent S2S tunnel so all their staging/test environments can be accessed by TestMu AI securely, without exposing them on the public internet or managing tunnels manually.
