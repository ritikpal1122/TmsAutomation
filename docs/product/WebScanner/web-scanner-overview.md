## What is TestMu AI Web Scanner?[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/web-scanner-overview#what-is--web-scanner "Direct link to what-is--web-scanner")

TestMu AI Web Scanner is an AI-powered, browser-based scanning platform designed to help teams identify and resolve visual and accessibility issues across web applications. It enables both automated Visual UI Regression Testing and WCAG-compliant Accessibility Testing, allowing organizations to proactively catch visual bugs and accessibility violations across thousands of URLs at scale.

This tool empowers QA teams, developers, and compliance managers to perform scheduled scans on public or locally-hosted sites, compare builds visually with pixel-perfect precision, and generate audit-ready accessibility reports.

  * Automated visual comparisons across multiple browsers and resolutions powered by SmartUI
  * Accessibility audits powered by dynamic WCAG checks
  * Smart scheduling of one-time or recurring scans
  * Support for authenticated and local testing pages
