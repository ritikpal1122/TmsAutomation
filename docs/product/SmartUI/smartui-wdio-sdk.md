          ],  
          [  
            1028  
          ]  
        ] // Full Page screenshots are captured by default for web viewports  
      },  
      "mobile": {  
        "devices": [  
          "iPhone 14",  //iPhone 14 viewport  
          "Galaxy S24"  //Galaxy S24 viewport  
        ],  
        "fullPage": true, //Full Page is true by default for mobile viewports  
        "orientation": "portrait" //Change to "landscape" for landscape snapshot  
      },  
      "waitForTimeout": 1000, //Optional (Should only be used in case lazy-loading/async components are present)  
      "waitForPageRender": 50000, //Optional (Should only be used in case of websites which take more than 30s to load)  
      "enableJavaScript": false, //Enable javascript for all the screenshots of the project  
      "allowedHostnames": [] //Additional hostnames to capture assets from  
    }  
    

Advanced options in SmartUI configuration

  * For capturing fullpage or viewport screenshots, please refer to this [documentation](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-sdk-config-options/#12-viewports)

  * You can incorporate SmartUI into your custom `WebdriverIO` automation test (any platform) script by adding the `smartuiSnapshot` function in the required segment of WebdriverIO script of which we would like to take the screenshot, as shown below:

    
    
    const { expect, browser, $ } = require('@wdio/globals')  
    const { smartuiSnapshot } = require('@lambdatest/wdio-driver');  
      
    describe('My first visual test', () => {  
        it('should use appropriate project token', async () => {  
            await browser.url(`https://webdriver.io`)  
            await smartuiSnapshot(browser, "SS-1");  
      
        })  
    })  
    

### **Step 6:** Execute the Tests on SmartUI Cloud[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-wdio-sdk#step-6-execute-the-tests-on-smartui-cloud "Direct link to step-6-execute-the-tests-on-smartui-cloud")

Execute `visual regression tests` on SmartUI using the following commands
    
    
    npx smartui --config .smartui.json exec -- wdio run ./wdio.conf.js  
    

note

You can use your custom runner command in place of `wdio run ./wdio.conf.js` You may use the `npx smartui --help` command in case you are facing issues during the execution of SmartUI commands in the CLI.

## View SmartUI Results[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-wdio-sdk#view-smartui-results "Direct link to View SmartUI Results")

You have successfully integrated SmartUI SDK with your WebdriverIO tests. Visit your SmartUI project to view builds and compare snapshots between different test runs.

You can see the SmartUI dashboard to view the results. This will help you identify the Mismatches from the existing `Baseline` build and do the required visual testing.

![cmd](https://www.testmuai.com/support/assets/images/smartui-sdk-results-primer-eb737d32d53cdf404c62d2f63abd3a1b.webp)

## Arguments supported in the `smartUISnapshot` function[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-wdio-sdk#arguments-supported-in-the-smartuisnapshot-function "Direct link to arguments-supported-in-the-smartuisnapshot-function")

The following are the different options which are currently supported:

Key| Description  
---|---  
`browser` (instance)| The instance of the browser used in your tests.  
`"Screenshot Name"` (string)| Specify a name for the screenshot in your tests to match the same screenshot with the name from your baseline.  
`options` (object)| Specify one or a combination of selectors in the `ignoreDOM` or `selectDOM` objects. These selectors can be based on `HTML DOM IDs, CSS classes, CSS selectors, or XPaths` used by your webpage. They define elements that should be excluded from or included in the visual comparison.  
  
## Handling Dynamic Data in SmartUI SDK **New**[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-wdio-sdk#handling-dynamic-data-in-smartui-sdk-- "Direct link to handling-dynamic-data-in-smartui-sdk--")

When conducting visual tests, you may encounter scenarios where certain elements within your application change between test runs. These changes might introduce inconsistencies in your test results.You can ignore / select specific element(s) to be removed from the comparison by parsing the options in the `smartuiSnapshot` function in the following way

  * Ignore ID
  * Ignore Class
  * Ignore XPath
  * Ignore CSS Selector

This is a sample for your configuration for JavaScript to ignore by
    
    
    let options = {  
                ignoreDOM: {  
                    id: ["ID-1", "ID-2"],  
                }  
            }

## Best Practices[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-wdio-sdk#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

  * Screenshot Naming
  * Wait for Page Load
  * Handle Dynamic Content
  * Configuration Management
  * Test Organization

**Screenshot Naming**

  * Use descriptive, consistent names for screenshots
  * Include page/component name in screenshot names
  * Avoid special characters that might cause issues
  * Use consistent naming conventions across your test suite

**Example:**
    
    
     await smartuiSnapshot(driver, 'HomePage-Header');  
    await smartuiSnapshot(driver, 'ProductPage-MainContent');  
    

**Wait for Page Load**

  * Always wait for pages to fully load before taking screenshots
  * Use WebdriverIO's built-in wait methods for dynamic content
  * Consider using `waitForTimeout` in configuration for lazy-loaded content

**Example:**
    
    
     await browser.url('https://example.com');  
    await $('#main-content').waitForDisplayed({ timeout: 10000 });  
    await smartuiSnapshot(driver, 'Page Loaded');  
    

**Handle Dynamic Content**

  * Use `ignoreDOM` for elements that change between runs
  * Use `selectDOM` when you only need to compare specific areas
  * Document why elements are ignored for future reference

**Configuration Management**

  * Keep `.smartui.json` in version control
  * Use environment variables for sensitive data
  * Document custom configuration choices

**Test Organization**

  * Group related screenshots in the same build
  * Use meaningful build names
  * Run tests in consistent environments

**Troubleshooting**

  * Screenshots Not Appearing in Dashboard
  * Project Not Found Error
  * Screenshots Show Blank or Incorrect Content
  * Build Execution Fails
  * npm Dependencies Not Resolving

**Solutions** :

  1. Add explicit waits before screenshots:
         
         await browser.url('https://example.com');  
         await $('#content').waitForDisplayed({ timeout: 10000 });  
         await $('.main-content').waitForDisplayed({ timeout: 10000 });  
         

  2. Enable JavaScript in configuration:
         
         {  
           enableJavaScript": true  
         }  
         

  3. Increase `waitForTimeout` in configuration

  4. Verify viewport size matches expected dimensions

**Issue: Build Execution Fails**

**Symptoms** : `npx smartui exec` command fails

**Possible Causes** :

  * Missing or incorrect configuration file
  * Invalid JSON in configuration
  * Port conflicts
  * Permission issues

**Solutions** :

  1. Verify `.smartui.json` exists and is valid JSON
  2. Check configuration file syntax
  3. Try different port if default is in use:
         
         npx smartui exec -P 5000 -- <command">  
         

  4. Check file permissions for configuration and project files

**Issue: npm Dependencies Not Resolving**

**Symptoms** : npm cannot find `@lambdatest/wdio-driver` or `@lambdatest/smartui-cli`

**Possible Causes** :

  * Incorrect package version
  * npm registry access issues
  * Network connectivity problems

**Solutions** :

  1. Check latest versions on npm:
         
         npm view @lambdatest/wdio-driver version  
         npm view @lambdatest/smartui-cli version  
         

  2. Clear npm cache:
         
         npm cache clean --force  
         

  3. Verify internet connectivity for npm registry access

  4. Check package.json for version conflicts

**Issue: Screenshot Names Not Matching Baseline**

**Symptoms** : Screenshots appear as New" instead of comparing with baseline

**Possible Causes** :

  * Screenshot name changed
  * Baseline doesn't exist
  * Name contains special characters

**Solutions** :

  1. Ensure screenshot names are consistent across test runs
  2. Verify baseline exists in project
  3. Avoid special characters in screenshot names
  4. Check for case sensitivity issues
