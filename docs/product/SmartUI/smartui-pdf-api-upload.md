## Prerequisites for Using SmartUI[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#prerequisites-for-using-smartui "Direct link to Prerequisites for Using SmartUI")

  * Familiarity with HTTP APIs is essential.
  * Visit the [`TestMu AI SmartUI`](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/) page and log in with your credentials.
  * Obtain your `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` by clicking on the `Access Key` button, located at the top right corner of your dashboard.

## Step 1: Establishing a SmartUI Project[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#step-1-establishing-a-smartui-project "Direct link to Step 1: Establishing a SmartUI Project")

To initiate a SmartUI PDF Comparison Project, adhere to the following instructions:

  1. Navigate to the [SmartUI Projects Page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/).
  2. Tap on the `new project` button.
  3. Specify your platform type as `PDF`.
  4. Provide your `project` name, designate `approvers`, and add `tags` (optional).
  5. Confirm your entry by clicking on **Submit**.

Once your project is active, retrieve your `Project Token` from the application. Here's an example of a project token:
    
    
    projectToken = "123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************"  
    

## Uploading PDFs via API[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#uploading-pdfs-via-api "Direct link to Uploading PDFs via API")

After setting up your SmartUI Project, you can upload your local PDF files to your project. This will automatically generate a build by capturing snapshots of every page.

Here's how you can upload your PDFs:

  1. Retrieve your API `URL Endpoint` post activation of your enterprise plan. To schedule a demonstration, click [here](https://www.lambdatest.com/demo).

  2. Append the following parameters to your request payload via `form-body`:

Variable| Type| Description| Required?  
---|---|---|---  
projectToken| string| This token is required to upload PDF files and validate your project.   
Example: `projectToken:123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************`| Yes  
pathToFiles| array| Add the path to the PDFs that will be uploaded.   
Example: `pathToFiles : [ "path/to/pdf-1", "path/to/pdf-2"]`| Yes  
buildName| string| Assign a name of your choice to the build comprising the uploaded PDFs.   
Example: `buildName : #<Build_Name>`| No  
  
note

Only files in `.pdf` format are compatible with this feature.

## API Request Example[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#api-request-example "Direct link to API Request Example")

Here's a sample API request using cURL:
    
    
    curl -X POST "YOUR_API_ENDPOINT" \  
      -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \  
      -F "projectToken=123456#1234abcd-****-****-****-************" \  
      -F "pathToFiles[]=path/to/document1.pdf" \  
      -F "pathToFiles[]=path/to/document2.pdf" \  
      -F "buildName=Release-v2.1"  
    

## Response Format[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#response-format "Direct link to Response Format")

The API will return a JSON response containing:

  * **Build ID** : Unique identifier for the uploaded build
  * **Status** : Upload status (success/failure)
  * **Pages Captured** : Number of pages processed
  * **Test Results** : Visual comparison results (if available)

## Use Cases[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#use-cases "Direct link to Use Cases")

  * **Automated CI/CD Integration** : Seamlessly integrate PDF testing into your deployment pipeline
  * **Batch Processing** : Upload multiple PDFs simultaneously for efficient testing
  * **Custom Workflows** : Build custom applications that interact with SmartUI programmatically
  * **Enterprise Integration** : Connect with existing enterprise systems and workflows

## Best Practices[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

  * PDF File Management
  * Project Token Management
  * Build Naming
  * Error Handling
  * Batch Processing

**PDF File Management**

  * Use consistent naming conventions for PDF files
  * Organize PDFs in logical directory structures
  * Verify PDF files are valid and not corrupted before upload
  * Keep PDF files in version control when appropriate

**Project Token Management**

  * Store project token as environment variable
  * Never commit tokens to version control
  * Use different tokens for different environments
  * Rotate tokens regularly

**Build Naming**

  * Use meaningful build names that include version info
  * Include date or version in build names
  * Use consistent naming conventions

**Example:**
    
    
     buildName="PDF-Comparison-v1.0-$(date +%Y%m%d)"  
    

**Error Handling**

  * Always check API response status
  * Handle network failures gracefully
  * Implement retry logic for transient failures
  * Log errors for debugging

**Batch Processing**

  * Process PDFs in batches for efficiency
  * Monitor upload progress
  * Handle partial failures in batch operations
  * Use appropriate batch sizes

## Troubleshooting[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/smartui-pdf-api-upload#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

  * PDF Upload Fails
  * Project Not Found Error
  * Upload Returns Error Response
  * PDFs Not Appearing in Dashboard

**Issue: PDF Upload Fails**

**Symptoms** : PDF upload returns error or fails silently

**Possible Causes** :

  * Invalid PDF file
  * File path incorrect
  * File size too large
  * Network connectivity issues
  * Project token incorrect
  * API endpoint incorrect

**Solutions** :

  1. Verify PDF file is valid and not corrupted
  2. Check file path is correct and accessible

  5. Verify PROJECT_TOKEN is set correctly
  6. Confirm API endpoint URL is correct

**Issue: "Project Not Found" Error**

**Symptoms** : Error message indicating project cannot be found

**Possible Causes** :

  * Incorrect project token
  * Project deleted or renamed
  * Token from wrong project

**Solutions** :

  1. Verify project exists in SmartUI dashboard
  2. Copy project token directly from Project Settings
  3. Ensure token includes the project ID prefix (e.g., `123456#...`)
  4. Check for extra spaces or quotes in token

**Issue: Upload Returns Error Response**

**Symptoms** : API returns error status or failure message

**Possible Causes** :

  * Invalid request format

  2. Check all required parameters are included
  3. Verify authentication credentials
  4. Review error response for specific details
  5. Retry upload if transient error

**Issue: PDFs Not Appearing in Dashboard**

**Symptoms** : Uploads complete but PDFs don't appear in SmartUI dashboard

**Possible Causes** :

  * Incorrect project token
  * Project name mismatch
  * Upload not completed
  * Dashboard refresh needed

**Solutions** :

  1. Verify PROJECT_TOKEN is correct
  2. Check project name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
  3. Wait a few moments and refresh dashboard
  4. Check upload response for errors
  5. Review API response for upload status
