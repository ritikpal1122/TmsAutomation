Hive is an online project management application that aims at maximizing your workplace productivity. With Hive you can plan project flexible and organize them in a Gantt chart, kanban board, table, or calendar. You can also keep a check on multiple projects simultaneously using their views and they also offer summary views to help you combine several projects in a single space, so you can visualize where all the teams are headed. TestMu AI integration with Hive helps to manage your bugs in Hive by moving them into a project through a single click effort. All the details you provide in TestMu AI like task list, assignee, title and description would automatically be presented in the project on Hive.

The TestMu AI Hive integration helps you in filing issues to your project in Hive directly from TestMu AI platform. With one-click integration, you can push annotated issues to the project of your choice, assign it to the required teammate, and attach necessary screenshots. You can do all that while in the middle of a test session in TestMu AI platform. The fields populated by you when marking as a bug through TestMu AI are displayed as information on the Hive for a testing instance.

> Hive Integration with TestMu AI, like all of the integrations to 3rd party applications, is available for freemium as well as premium plan.

> **What is an API key?** When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API key is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API key has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API keys are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

**Step 5:** You can find your Hive User ID & API key from your Hive workspace. Click the display picture on the top right and go to **Edit profile**.
