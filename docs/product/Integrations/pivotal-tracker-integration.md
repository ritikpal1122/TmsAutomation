Pivotal Tracker offers a project management platform on cloud. Designed for Agile teams, the tracker helps you organize your release cycle through an intuitive dashboard where everyone can monitor who is working on what, along with their upcoming tasks! Also, a shared backlog is there to help the team prioritize tasks which require more attention. Tracker automatically calculates your team's velocity by analyzing the past iterations, to help you calculate ETAs on your future sprints.

TestMu AI integration with Pivotal Tracker will help you instantly log UI bugs from TestMu AI to your projects on the Pivotal Tracker. That way, you can report any cross browser compatibility issues with your team as soon as you encounter them while cross browser testing with TestMu AI.

**Step 6:** Scroll down on your Profile page and you will find a section where you have your API token generated. This API token will help you authenticate your access as you integrate your Pivotal tracker with any third-party applications. Please handle the API token with care. Treat them as your passwords as somebody else can authenticate a third-party application on your behalf. In case you feel your API token has been revealed to someone you don't trust then you can create a new API token in the Pivotal tracker. You can also remove an older API token if you like.
