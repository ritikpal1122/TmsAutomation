**Step 1:** Login to your TestMu AI account. You would need to have Admin or User level access to see and install integrations.

**Step 2:** Select **âIntegrationsâ** from the left navigation menu bar. This will guide you to a screen where you will find a list of 3rd party applications, available to integrate with your TestMu AI account.

**Step 3:** Click on **âADDâ** under the block that says **âPaymoâ.**

**Step 4:** Once you click on install, you will be redirected to the below screen. You will be asked to provide your **Paymo API Token** credentials in the highlighted fields to establish integration with TestMu AI.

![api token](https://www.testmuai.com/support/assets/images/paymo-api-token-b7f94e32995b509bb5eb1b6ac71e2e33.webp)

> **What is an API token?**  
>  When two different applications interact with each other, a server-to-server communication is established. API token is needed for authenticating user identity from one server to another, by fetching user-owned resources available on the server from where the communication is initiated. API token has been a necessity for maintaining security and data integrity of any application. They are just as vital to an end user as they are to an application. API tokens are relevant if an end user logs in an application through a 2-step verification process.

**Step 5:** You can find your API token from your **Paymoapp** instance. If you have not generated one before, you can generate an API token by going to the **settings.** The settings icon will be visible once you hover the mouse on the bottom left side where your name and display image is placed. We have highlighted the part you need to hover in red. Click on the settings icon.

![instance](https://www.testmuai.com/support/assets/images/paymo-instance-6ca170c8fe9c1cc7322dac459adeb14c.webp)

**Step 6:** As you click on settings icon, go to **"Your Settings".**

![settings](https://www.testmuai.com/support/assets/images/paymo-settings-3d27deb04bab7595decae14b83c03a39.webp)

**Step 7:** Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will find a section for **"APP PASSWORDS(API KEYS)".** Mention any input you like in the box & click on **âGenerateâ.**

![generate password](https://www.testmuai.com/support/assets/images/paymo-generatepassword-ec3b1564419781b09af11fb8bf208895.webp)

**Step 8:** As you click on **âGenerateâ,** your API key will be pop-up on your screen. Copy the API key now as it wonât be visible once you click **OK.**

![app password](https://www.testmuai.com/support/assets/images/paymo-apppassword-cd9adfe6172e088731dfebbb5db6953f.webp)

You can keep a note of this API token with you for future authentication. Although, in case you forget to do so, or you end up neglecting it due to some reason. Then there is no need to panic! You can create a new token by defining a new label. You can also **delete** a previously declared API Key, in case you feel that your API Key has been placed in some wrong hands. You can delete an API Key by hovering over the label and clicking on the **bin** icon.
