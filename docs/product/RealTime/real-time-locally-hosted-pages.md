The [TestMu AI Tunnel](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) feature enables you to perform secure and real-time testing of locally hosted websites, private servers, and web applications that are behind a corporate firewall. By creating a secure connection between your local environment and the TestMu AI cloud, the Tunnel allows you to access and test internal applications on various browsers and devices.
