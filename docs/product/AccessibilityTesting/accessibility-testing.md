This includes people with:

  * **Visual impairments:** Blindness, low vision, color blindness.

Based on [**WebAIM's research**](https://webaim.org/projects/million/), there is a significant disparity in digital inclusivity, with **95.9%** of the top 1 million websites not meeting basic accessible standards. This disparity highlights the importance of accessibility testing to ensure digital spaces are accessible to all.

The following explains why accessibility testing is essential:

  * **Meeting Accessibility Standards:** Ensuring your platform meets essential accessibility guidelines such as WCAG, ADA, and Section 508 not only reduces legal risks but also supports inclusivity and provides equal access for all users.
  * **Digital Inclusivity:** Users with disabilities can access content, eliminating barriers for those with visual, auditory, or motor impairments.
  * **Wider Audience Reach:** Over 2 billion people worldwide live with impairments. By using accessibility testing, you can reach this untapped market and grow your clientele.
  * **Improved Usability for All Users:** Features like enhanced colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and alternate text make your website easier to use for all users.
  * **Future-Proofing Your Digital Presence:** Using inclusive design now guarantees that your platform will remain ahead of the curve and relevant as accessibility standards change.

## The European Accessibility Act (EAA)[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/accessibility-testing#the-european-accessibility-act-eaa "Direct link to The European Accessibility Act \(EAA\)")

> The [European Accessibility Act (EAA)](https://accessible-eu-centre.ec.europa.eu/content-corner/news/eaa-comes-effect-june-2025-are-you-ready-2025-01-31_en), effective from June 2025, is a groundbreaking regulation made to improve accessibility across the European Union. This act guarantees the accessibility of digital products and services to all individuals, including the 135 million people living with disabilities in the EU. It gives businesses a clear requirement to design products and services that are accessible to everyone, breaking down digital barriers and inclusivity.

### Scope of the EAA[â](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/accessibility-testing#scope-of-the-eaa "Direct link to Scope of the EAA")
