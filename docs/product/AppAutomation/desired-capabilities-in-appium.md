Real Device Virtual Device

Desired capabilities in [Appium](https://www.lambdatest.com/appium) are essential for guiding the Appium server to create the correct test automation environment. Represented as a set of key-value pairs within a JSON object, these capabilities allow [QA automation](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/qa-automation/) engineers to specify the desired mobile platform and configuration for their test sessions.

By setting these parameters, QAs can ensure that the Appium server accurately targets the intended test environment, facilitating effective and efficient [mobile app testing](https://www.lambdatest.com/mobile-app-testing).

> **Note:** With TestMu AI [capabilities generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/) run your App Automation leveraging Appium Desktop.
